.Sh NAME
.Nm ptsort
.Nd Prioritized topological sort
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ddpqsv
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Ar input ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility takes a directed acyclic graph of nodes as input and outputs
the nodes in topological order.
Unlike
.Xr tsort 1 ,
the
.Nm ptsort
utility allows nodes to be given a numeric priority.
Priorities are propagated along edges so that each node's priority is
greater than the priority of all its successors.
Thus, it is possible to boost a specific node so that it, and all its
predecessors, will be listed ahead of other unrelated nodes.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl D
Sort the output by depth first instead of priority first.
.It Fl d
Include each node's depth in the output.
.It Fl p
Include each node's priority in the output.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode.
Do not warn about cycles in the input.
.It Fl s
Strict mode.
Cycles in the input will cause
.Nm
to terminate with an exit code of 3.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Show detailed information while building and traversing the graph.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility takes its input either from the files listed on the command
line or, if no files were specified, from the standard input.
All input is read into the same graph before processing.
.Pp
Each input line contains either two names or a name and a decimal
integer, separated by any amount of whitespace.
Any amount of leading or trailing whitespace is permitted.
Names are arbitrary non-empty sequences of up to 255 printable,
non-whitespace ASCII characters.
It is strictly speaking possible, but not a good idea, for a node's
name to consist entirely of digits.
.Pp
If the line contains two names, the effect is to insert a directed
edge into the graph going from the first (predecessor) node to the
second (successor) node.
Either or both nodes are created if they do not already exist.
If both names are identical, no edge is inserted, but the node is
still created unless it already exists.
.Pp
If the line contains a name and a number, the effect is to raise the
priority of that node to the given number, unless it is already
higher.
The node will be created if it does not already exist.
.Pp
Blank lines in the input are ignored.
.Pp
Any error in the input will cause
.Nm
to print an error message which includes the offending line and
terminate with an exit code of 2.
.Pp
If no error occurred, the
.Nm
utility ouputs one line for each node in the graph, consisting of the
node's name optionally preceded by its depth (if the
.Fl d
option was specified) and / or priority (if the
.Fl p
option was specified).
By default, the list is sorted in decreasing order of priority, then
depth, then name.
If the
.Fl D
option was specified, it is sorted in decreasing order of depth, then
priority, then name.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If an error occurred, the
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following codes:
.Bl -tag -width 999
.It 1
An error occurred while opening or reading from an input file or while
trying to allocate memory.
.It 2
A syntax error was encountered in the input.
.It 3
A cycle was detected while running in strict mode.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, it exits with code 0.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility and this manual page were written by
.An Dag-Erling Sm\(/orgrav Aq Mt des@des.no .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility uses a completely different algorithm than the similar
.Xr tsort 1
and may therefore produce different (but toplogically equivalent)
output when given the same input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility should probably have been named
.Nm klatch ,
but the author has no imagination or appreciation for the literary
arts.
