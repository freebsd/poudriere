.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
During the build, hit
.Ic ^T
to send
.Dv SIGINFO
and show stats and progress about the build.
.Pp
See the
.Em FLAVORS
section
in
.Xr poudriere 8
for supported flavors syntax.
.Pp
See
the
.Em CUSTOMIZATION
section
in
.Xr poudriere 8
to learn how to build binary packages with options that differ from
defaults.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width "-f file"
.It Fl a
Build all ports in the tree with all flavors.
.It Fl f Ar file
Build ports listed in the
.Ar file .
.Pp
The path to the
.Ar file
has to be absolute.
Ports must be specified in the form of
.Dq Ar category Ns / Ns Ar port
and
.Xr sh 1 Ns -style
comments are allowed.
Multiple
.Fl f Ar file
arguments may be specified at once.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-B name"
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS
will be used.
This can be used to resume a previous build and use the same log and URL paths.
Resuming a build will not retry built/failed/skipped/ignored packages.
.It Fl C
Clean only the packages specified on the command line or in the file given by
.Fl f Ar file .
Implies
.Fl c
for
.Fl a .
.It Fl c
Clean
.Em all
previously built packages and logs.
.It Fl F
Fetch only from the original
.Va MASTER_SITES .
Skip
.Fx
mirrors.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
.Pp
Open an interactive shell session in the jail after the build is done and before the clean-up.
It is a convenient way to do some additional testing.
.Pp
A local
.Xr pkg.conf 5
repository configuration will be installed to
.No ${ Ns Va LOCALBASE Ns } Ns Pa /etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
so that
.Xr pkg 8
can be used with any existing packages built for the jail.
The
default
.Fx
repository will be disabled by default.
.It Fl j Ar name
Run the bulk build on the jail named
.Ar name .
.It Fl J Ar maxjobs Ns Op Cm \&: Ns Ar prebuildmaxjobs
Specify the number of jobs that will run in parallel for a bulk build.
The optional second parameter,
.Ar prebuildmaxjobs ,
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.
The default pre-build value is 1.25 times the value of the build value.
.It Fl I
Advanced interactive mode.
.Pp
Leave the jail running with ports installed after building and testing.
It is a convenient way to do some additional testing.
See
.Xr poudriere-jail 8
to learn how to stop a running poudriere jail.
.Pp
Similarly to
.Fl i ,
the
.Fl I
flag
will cause
.Xr pkg.conf 5
to be installed in the jail.
.It Fl k
Do not consider failures to be fatal
when using
.Fl t .
Do not skip dependent ports on findings.
This flag is automatically set when using
.Fl at .
.It Fl N
Do not build a package repository when the build is completed.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Show what would be done, but do not actually build or delete any
packages.
.It Fl O Ar overlays
Specify extra ports trees to overlay.
.It Fl p Ar tree
Specify on which ports
.Ar tree
the bulk build will be done.
.It Fl R
Clean
.Va RESTRICTED
packages after building.
.It Fl r
Recursively test all dependencies as well.
This flag is automatically set when using
.Fl at .
.It Fl S
Do not recursively rebuild packages affected by other packages requiring
incremental rebuild.
This may result in broken packages if the ones they depend on are updated,
are not ABI-compatible, and were not properly
.Va PORTREVISION
bumped.
.It Fl T
Try building
.Va BROKEN
ports by defining
.Va TRYBROKEN
for the build.
.It Fl t
Add some testing to the specified ports.
Add
.Fl r
to recursively test all port dependencies as well.
Currently, the behavior is to uninstall a port, and to disable parallel jobs
for
.Xr make 1 .
When used with
.Fl a
then
.Fl rk
are implied.
.It Fl v
Enable additional information to be shown during the build.
Specify twice to enable debug output.
.It Fl w
Save
.Va WRKDIR
on build failure.
The
.Va WRKDIR
will be tarred up into
.No ${ Ns Va POUDRIERE_DATA Ns } Ns Pa /wrkdirs .
.It Fl W
Mount ports tree in read-write mode, allowing to patch it in interactive mode.
.It Fl z Ar set
This specifies which SET to use for the build.
See the
.Em CUSTOMIZATION
section in
.Xr poudriere 8
for examples of how this is used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width 0n
.It Sy Example 1\&: No Starting a Bulk Build
.Pp
The following example starts a bulk build of two ports.
