binary packages built from a given list of ports.
During the build, hit ^T to send
.Dv SIGINFO
and get stats and progress back.
.It image
This command allows you to create images.
.It jail
This command allows you to manage the jails used by
.Nm
which are building environments differing by OS version and architecture.
.It ports
This command allows you to manage different portstrees which will be used
by
.Nm
(create, update and delete portstrees).
.It testport
This command, mainly targeted at ports developers, launches a
test on a given port (useful before submitting/committing a port).
.It options
This command allows to configure the options for a given port
.It logclean
This command will cleanup old logfiles
.It distclean
This command will cleanup old distfiles
.It pkgclean
This command will cleanup old and unwanted packages
.It queue

to know how to build binary packages with options that differs from
defaults.
.Pp
Here are the options associated with the
.Cm bulk
command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS
will be used.
This can be used to resume a previous build and use the same log and URL paths.
Resuming a build will not retry built/failed/skipped/ignored packages.
.It Fl c
Clean
.Em all
previously built packages and logs.
.It Fl C
Clean only the packages specified on the command line or in in the file given in

.It Fl J Ar number[:number]
This argument specifies how many
.Ar number
jobs will run in parallel for a bulk build.
The optional second
.Ar number
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.
The default pre-build value is 1.25 times the value of the build value.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
Enter jail for interactive testing and automatically cleanup when done.
A local
.Xr pkg.conf 5
repository configuration will be installed to

so that
.Xr pkg 8
can be used with any existing packages built for the jail.
The
.Fx
repository will be disabled by default.
.It Fl I

Leaves jail running with ports installed after test.
When done with the jail you will need to manually shut it down:
.Dl "poudriere jail -k -j JAILNAME" .
As with
.Fl i
this will install a

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss bulk build of binary packages
This first example provides a guide on how to use
.Nm
for bulk build packages.
.Pp
.Bq Prepare infrastructure
.Pp
First you have to create a jail, which will hold all the building
infrastructure needs.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.2-RELEASE -a amd64 -j 82amd64"
.Pp
A jail will take approximately 3GB of space.
.Pp
Of course you can use another version of
.Fx ,
regardless of what version you are running.
amd64 users can choose i386 arch like in this
example:
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.1-RELEASE -a i386 -j 81i386"
.Pp
This command will fetch and install a minimal jail, small (~400MB) so
you can create a lot of them.
It will install the jail under the pool
you have chosen, at poudriere/jailname.
.Pp
You also need to have at least one ports tree to build packages from it,
so let us take the default configuration by creating a ports tree.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere ports -c"
.Pp
A ports tree will take approximately 4GB of space.
.Pp
.Bq Specify a list of ports you want to build
.Pp
Create a flat text file in which you put the ports you want to see
built by poudriere.
.Pp
.Dl "echo 'sysutils/screen' > ~/pkglist"
.Dl "echo 'editors/vim' >> ~/pkglist"
.Pp
Any line starting with the hash sign will be treated as a comment.
.Pp
.Bq Launch the bulk build
.Pp
Now you can launch the bulk build.
You can specify to build for only one
arch/version ; by default it will make the bulk build on all the jails
created by poudriere.
.Dl "poudriere bulk -f ~/pkglist -j 81i386"
.Pp
.Bq Find your packages
.Pp
Once the bulk build is over, you can meet your shiny new packages here:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/81i386
.Pp
with 81i386 as the name of the jail.
.Ss test a single port
This second example show how to use
.Nm
for a single port.
.Pp
Let's take the example of building a single port;
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere testport -o category/port -j myjail"
.Pp
all the tests will be done in myjail.
.Pp
It starts the jail, then mount the ports tree (nullfs), then mounts the
package dir (pourdriere/data/packages/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>), then it mounts the
~/ports-cvs/mybeautifulporttotest (nullfs) it builds all the dependencies
(except runtime ones) and log it to
poudriere/data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log).
.Pp
If packages for the dependencies already exists it will use them
.Pp
When all the dependencies are built, packages for them are created so
that next time it will be faster.
.Pp
All the dependency phase is done with PREFIX == LOCALBASE.
.Pp
After that it will build the port itself with LOCALBASE != PREFIX
and log the build to
poudriere/data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log
.Pp
It will try to:
install it,
create a package from it,
deinstall it,
check for cruft left behind and
propose the line to add to pkg-plist if needed.
.Pp
It is very easy to extend it so that we can easily add other tests if
wanted.
.Sh FLAVORS
.Cm bulk -a
will build all FLAVORS for each port.
Otherwise
.Cm bulk
and
.Cm testport
use the following rules:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
A FLAVOR of
.Sy bar
for port
.Pa devel/foo
is specified as
.Sy devel/foo@bar .
.El
.Pp
If
.Va FLAVOR_DEFAULT_ALL
is not set, or is set to
.Sy no
(the default), in
.Pa poudriere.conf,
then:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
All FLAVORS for a port, without a specified FLAVOR, will be built
using the FLAVOR
.Sy all :
.Sy devel/foo@all .
.It
The first (default) FLAVOR for a port is built by not specifying a FLAVOR:
.Sy devel/foo .
.El
.Pp
If
.Va FLAVOR_DEFAULT_ALL
is set to
.Sy yes
in
.Pa poudriere.conf,
then:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
All FLAVORS for a port, without a specified FLAVOR, will be built:
.Sy devel/foo .
.It
The first (default) FLAVOR for a port is built by specifying the FLAVOR
.Sy - :
.Sy devel/foo@-
.El
.Pp
.Ss KNOWN ISSUES
.Bl -bullet -compat
.It
An invalid FLAVOR for a port will cause an error during dependency calculation.
.It
MOVED entries do not support a source FLAVOR, only a target one.
.El
.Sh CUSTOMISATION
For bulk building, you can customize binary packages produced by
.Nm
by changing build options port by port, and you can also specify
building directives in a make.conf file.
.Ss Custom build options
Before building a package,
.Nm
can mount a directory containing option files if available.
.Nm
will check for any of these directories in this order:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-<setname>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-options
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options
.Pp
If a directory with this name exists, it is null-mounted into the
.Pa /var/db/ports/
directory of the jail, thus allowing to build package
with custom OPTIONS.
.Pp
The
.Cm options
subcommand can be used to easily configure options in the correct directory.
.Pp
This directory has the usual layout for options: it contains one directory per
port (the name of the port) containing an 'options' file with lines similar to:
.Pp
.Dl WITH_FOO=true
.Dl WITHOUT_BAR=true
.Pp
As a starter, you may want to copy an existing
.Pa /var/db/ports/
to
.Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options .
.Ss Blacklist ports
You can also specify a blacklist which will disallow the lists port origins
from building on the matched jail.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-<setname>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-blacklist
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-blacklist
.Pp
If QEMU is being used then a special qemu blacklist is also loaded.
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/qemu-blacklist
.Ss Create optional poudriere.conf
You can also specify an optional poudriere.conf that is pulled in
depending on the build.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-<setname>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-poudriere.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-poudriere.conf
.Ss Create optional make.conf
You can also specify a global make.conf which will be used for all the
jails.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-<setname>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-make.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-make.conf
The
.Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/hooks/plugins/<plugin>/
directory may contain any of the above patterns as well.
.Ss Create optional src.conf
You can also specify a global src.conf which will be used for building
jails with the
.Cm jail -c
subcommand.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/src.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-src.conf
.Dl Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-src.conf
.Ss Create optional src-env.conf
You can also specify a global src-env.conf which will be used for building
jails with the
.Cm jail -c
subcommand.

.Sh CAVEATS
.Ss Jailname
.Fl j ,
.Fl z
and
.Fl p
are all used in the name of the jail.
.Pp
Be careful to respect the names supported by jail(8):
.Bd -literal
    "This is an arbitrary string that identifies a jail (except it
     may not contain a '.')"
.Ed
.Pp
Be also careful to not begin the name of the jail by a number if you are
not in -stable or current:
