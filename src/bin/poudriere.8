.Sh NAME
.Nm poudriere
.Nd bulk package builder and port tester
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm command
.Cm subcommand
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool is used to build packages from the FreeBSD ports tree.
It can also be used to test a single port.
.Pp
Its goals are to use modern facilities present in FreeBSD (as ZFS,
jails), to be easy to use and to depend only on base.
.Sh GLOBAL OPTIONS
.Nm
accepts a global option:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl e Ar etcdir
Path to the directory where poudriere will find its configuration data.
See 
.Sx FILES
and
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
for more information.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The first argument to
.Nm
must be a
.Cm command
from the following list:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It bulk
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
During the build, hit ^T to send
.Dv SIGINFO
and get stats and progress back.
.It jail
This command gives you control to manage the jails used by
.Nm
to provide building environment (different FreeBSD versions, different
architectures).
.It ports
This command allows you to manage different portstrees which will be used
by
.Nm
(create, update and delete portstrees).
.It testport
This command, mainly targeted at FreeBSD ports developers, launches a
test on a given port (useful before submitting/committing a port).
.It options
This command allows to configure the options for a given port
.It distclean
This command will cleanup old distfiles
.It pkgclean
This command will cleanup old and unwanted packages
.It queue
This command allows a non-root user to queue
.Nm
commands.
.It status
This command shows status of current and previous builds
.It version
Show version of poudriere.
.Nm.
.El

These subcommands are mutually exclusive.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl a

Multiple
.Fl f Ar file
arguments may be specified at once.

Here are the options associated with the
.Cm bulk
command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default 
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS

previously built packages and logs.
.It Fl C
Clean only the packages specified on the command line or in in the file given in
.Fl f Ar file
.
.It Fl F
Only fetch from original MASTER_SITES.

.It Fl j Ar name
Run the bulk build on the jail named
.Ar name .
.It Fl J Ar number[:number]
This argument specifies how many
.Ar number
jobs will run in parallel for a bulk build.
The optional second
.Ar number
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.

Sanity tests are made to check if the ports exists,
does not have an increased version number, and if the compiled options
match the current options from the make.conf files and /var/db/options.
.It Fl t

Currently uninstalls the port, and disable parallel
jobs for make.
.It Fl r
Recrusively test all dependencies as well.

.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss bulk build of binary packages
This first example provides a guide on how to use
.Nm
for bulk build packages.
.Pp
.Bq Prepare infrastructure
.Pp
First you have to create a jail, which will hold all the building
infrastructure needs.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.2-RELEASE -a amd64 -j 82amd64"
.Pp
A jail will take approximately 3GB of space.
.Pp
Of course you can use another version of FreeBSD, regarless on what
version you are running.
amd64 users can choose i386 arch like in this
example:
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.1-RELEASE -a i386 -j 81i386"
.Pp
This command will fetch and install a minimal jail, small (~400MB) so
you can create a lot of them.
It will install the jail under the pool
you have chosen, at poudriere/jailname.
.Pp
You also need to have at least one ports tree to build packages from it,
so let us take the default configuration by creating a ports tree.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere ports -c"
.Pp
A ports tree will take approximately 4GB of space.
.Pp
.Bq Specify a list of ports you want to build
.Pp
Create a flat text file in which you put the ports you want to see
built by poudriere.
.Pp
.Dl "echo 'sysutils/screen' > ~/pkglist"
.Dl "echo 'editors/vim' >> ~/pkglist"
.Pp
Any line starting with the hash sign will be treated as a comment.
.Pp
.Bq Launch the bulk build
.Pp
Now you can launch the bulk build.
You can specify to build for only one
arch/version ; by default it will make the bulk build on all the jails
created by poudriere.
.Dl "poudriere bulk -f ~/pkglist -j 81i386"
.Pp
.Bq Find your packages
.Pp
Once the bulk build is over, you can meet your shiny new packages here:
.Pp
.Dl "/usr/local/poudriere_data/packages/81i386"
.Pp
with 81i386 as the name of the jail.
.Ss test a single port
This second example show how to use
.Nm
for a single port.
.Pp
Let's take the example of building a single port;
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere testport -o category/port -j myjail"
.Pp
all the tests will be done in myjail.
.Pp
It starts the jail, then mount the ports tree (nullfs), then mounts the
package dir (pourdriere_data/packages/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>), then it mounts the
~/ports-cvs/mybeautifulporttotest (nullfs) it builds all the dependencies
(except runtime ones) and log it to
poudriere_data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log).
.Pp
If packages for the dependencies already exists it will use them
.Pp
When all the dependencies are built, packages for them are created so
that next time it will be faster.
.Pp
All the dependency phase is done with PREFIX == LOCALBASE.
.Pp
After that it will build the port itself with LOCALBASE != PREFIX
and log the build to
poudriere_data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log
.Pp
It will try to:
install it,
create a package from it,
deinstall it,
check for cruft left behind and
propose the line to add to pkg-plist if needed.
.Pp
It is very easy to extend it so that we can easily add other tests if
wanted.
.Sh CUSTOMISATION
For bulk building, you can customize binary packages produced by
.Nm
by changing build options port by port, and you can also specify
building directives in a make.conf file.
.Ss Custom build options
Before building a package,
.Nm
can mount a directory containing option files if available.
.Nm
will check for any of these directories in this order:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options
.Pp
If a directory with this name exists, it is null-mounted into the
/var/db/ports/ directory of the jail, thus allowing to build package
with custom OPTIONS.
.Pp
The
.Cm options
subcommand can be used to easily configure options in the correct directory.
.Pp
This directory has the usual layout for options: it contains one directory per
port (the name of the port) containing an 'options' file with lines similar to:
.Pp
.Dl WITH_FOO=true
.Dl WITHOUT_BAR=true
.Pp
As a starter, you may want to copy an existing /var/db/ports/ to
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options.
.Ss Create optional make.conf
You can also specify a global make.conf which will be used for all the
jails.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-make.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-make.conf
.Ss Create optional src.conf
You can also specify a global src.conf which will be used for building
jails with the
.Cm jail -c
subcommand.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/src.conf
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-src.conf
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Nm
command must be used on a recent version of FreeBSD, i.e. a version
which has ZFS >= v15, and a zpool.
.Sh CAVEATS
.Ss Jailname
.Fl j
is the name of the jail which will also be the name of the zfs
filesystem.
.Pp
Be careful to respects the names supported by jail(8):
.Pp
.Bd -literal
    "This is an arbitrary string that identifies a jail (except it
     may not contain a '.')"
.Ed
.Pp
Be also careful to not begin the name of the jail by a number if you are
not in -stable or current:
