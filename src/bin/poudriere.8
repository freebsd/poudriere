.Nd bulk package builder and port tester
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm command
.Cm subcommand
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool is used to build packages from the ports tree.
It can also be used to test a single port.
.Sh GLOBAL OPTIONS
.Nm
accepts a global option:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl e Ar etcdir
Path to the directory where poudriere will find its configuration data.
See 
.Sx FILES
and

.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The first argument to
.Nm
must be a
.Cm command
from the following list:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It bulk
This command makes a ready-to-export package tree, and fills it with
binary packages built from a given list of ports.
During the build, hit ^T to send
.Dv SIGINFO
and get stats and progress back.
.It jail
This command allows you to manage the jails used by
.Nm
which are building environments differing by OS version and architecture.
.It ports
This command allows you to manage different portstrees which will be used
by
.Nm
(create, update and delete portstrees).
.It testport
This command, mainly targeted at ports developers, launches a
test on a given port (useful before submitting/committing a port).
.It options
This command allows to configure the options for a given port
.It distclean
This command will cleanup old distfiles
.It pkgclean
This command will cleanup old and unwanted packages
.It queue
This command allows a non-root user to queue
.Nm
commands.
.It status
This command shows status of current and previous builds
.It version
Show version of poudriere.
.Nm.
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
Here are the list of subcommands and associated options supported by
.Nm ,
sorted by
.Cm command
order.
.Ss bulk
.Pp
These subcommands are mutually exclusive.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl a
Build all ports in the tree.
.It Fl f Ar file
Absolute path to a file which contains the list of ports to build.
Ports must be specified in the form
.Ar category/port
and shell-style comments are allowed.
Multiple
.Fl f Ar file
arguments may be specified at once.
.It cat/port cat/port2 ...
A list of ports can be specified directly.
.El
.Pp
See
.Sx CUSTOMISATION
to know how to build binary packages with options that differs from
defaults.
.Pp
Here are the options associated with the
.Cm bulk
command.
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default 
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS
will be used.
This can be used to resume a previous build and use the same log and URL paths.
Resuming a build will not retry built/failed/skipped/ignored packages.
.It Fl c
Clean
.Em all
previously built packages and logs.
.It Fl C
Clean only the packages specified on the command line or in in the file given in
.Fl f Ar file
.
.It Fl F
Only fetch from original MASTER_SITES.
Skip FreeBSD mirrors.
.It Fl j Ar name
Run the bulk build on the jail named
.Ar name .
.It Fl J Ar number[:number]
This argument specifies how many
.Ar number
jobs will run in parallel for a bulk build.
The optional second
.Ar number
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
Enter jail for interactive testing and automatically cleanup when done.
A local
.Xr pkg.conf 5
repository configuration will be installed to
.Pa LOCALBASE/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
so that
.Xr pkg 8
can be used with any existing packages built for the jail.
The FreeBSD repository will be disabled by default.
.It Fl I
Advanced Interactive mode.
Leaves jail running with ports installed after test.
When done with the jail you will need to manually shut it down:
.Dl "poudriere jail -k -j JAILNAME" .
As with
.Fl i
this will install a
.Xr pkg.conf 5
file for
.Xr pkg 8
usage.
.It Fl n
Dry run. Show what woud be done, but do not actually build or delete any
packages.
.It Fl N
Do not build package repository or INDEX when build is completed.
.It Fl p Ar tree
This flag specifies on which ports
.Ar tree
the bulk build will be done.
.It Fl R
Clean RESTRICTED packages after building.
.It Fl s
Skip incremental rebuild and sanity checks.
Sanity tests are made to check if the ports exists,
does not have an increased version number, packaged dependencies match,
pkgname matches, if the compiled options match the current options from the
.Pa make.conf
files and
.Pa /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options ,
and that its own dependencies did not require rebuild as well.
.It Fl S
Don't recrusively rebuild packages affected by other packages requiring
incremental rebuild.
This is a subset of
.Fl s .
This may result in broken packages if the ones they depend on are updated
and are not ABI-compatible.
.It Fl t
Add some testing to the specified ports.
Add
.Fl r
to recursively test all port dependencies as well.
Currently uninstalls the port, and disable parallel
jobs for make.
When used with

then
.Fl rk
are implied.
.It Fl r
Recursively test all dependencies as well.
This flag is automatically set when using

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss bulk build of binary packages
This first example provides a guide on how to use
.Nm
for bulk build packages.
.Pp
.Bq Prepare infrastructure
.Pp
First you have to create a jail, which will hold all the building
infrastructure needs.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.2-RELEASE -a amd64 -j 82amd64"
.Pp
A jail will take approximately 3GB of space.
.Pp
Of course you can use another version of FreeBSD, regarless on what
version you are running.
amd64 users can choose i386 arch like in this
example:
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere jail -c -v 8.1-RELEASE -a i386 -j 81i386"
.Pp
This command will fetch and install a minimal jail, small (~400MB) so
you can create a lot of them.
It will install the jail under the pool
you have chosen, at poudriere/jailname.
.Pp
You also need to have at least one ports tree to build packages from it,
so let us take the default configuration by creating a ports tree.
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere ports -c"
.Pp
A ports tree will take approximately 4GB of space.
.Pp
.Bq Specify a list of ports you want to build
.Pp
Create a flat text file in which you put the ports you want to see
built by poudriere.
.Pp
.Dl "echo 'sysutils/screen' > ~/pkglist"
.Dl "echo 'editors/vim' >> ~/pkglist"
.Pp
Any line starting with the hash sign will be treated as a comment.
.Pp
.Bq Launch the bulk build
.Pp
Now you can launch the bulk build.
You can specify to build for only one
arch/version ; by default it will make the bulk build on all the jails
created by poudriere.
.Dl "poudriere bulk -f ~/pkglist -j 81i386"
.Pp
.Bq Find your packages
.Pp
Once the bulk build is over, you can meet your shiny new packages here:
.Pp
.Dl "/usr/local/poudriere_data/packages/81i386"
.Pp
with 81i386 as the name of the jail.
.Ss test a single port
This second example show how to use
.Nm
for a single port.
.Pp
Let's take the example of building a single port;
.Pp
.Dl "poudriere testport -o category/port -j myjail"
.Pp
all the tests will be done in myjail.
.Pp
It starts the jail, then mount the ports tree (nullfs), then mounts the
package dir (pourdriere_data/packages/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>), then it mounts the
~/ports-cvs/mybeautifulporttotest (nullfs) it builds all the dependencies
(except runtime ones) and log it to
poudriere_data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log).
.Pp
If packages for the dependencies already exists it will use them
.Pp
When all the dependencies are built, packages for them are created so
that next time it will be faster.
.Pp
All the dependency phase is done with PREFIX == LOCALBASE.
.Pp
After that it will build the port itself with LOCALBASE != PREFIX
and log the build to
poudriere_data/logs/testport/jailname/default/mybeautifulporttotest.log
.Pp
It will try to:
install it,
create a package from it,
deinstall it,
check for cruft left behind and
propose the line to add to pkg-plist if needed.
.Pp
It is very easy to extend it so that we can easily add other tests if
wanted.
.Sh CUSTOMISATION
For bulk building, you can customize binary packages produced by
.Nm
by changing build options port by port, and you can also specify
building directives in a make.conf file.
.Ss Custom build options
Before building a package,
.Nm
can mount a directory containing option files if available.
.Nm
will check for any of these directories in this order:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-<tree>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-options
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options
.Pp
If a directory with this name exists, it is null-mounted into the
/var/db/ports/ directory of the jail, thus allowing to build package
with custom OPTIONS.
.Pp
The
.Cm options
subcommand can be used to easily configure options in the correct directory.
.Pp
This directory has the usual layout for options: it contains one directory per
port (the name of the port) containing an 'options' file with lines similar to:
.Pp
.Dl WITH_FOO=true
.Dl WITHOUT_BAR=true
.Pp
As a starter, you may want to copy an existing /var/db/ports/ to
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options.
.Ss Blacklist ports
You can also specify a blacklist which will disallow the lists port origins
from building on the matched jail.
Any of the following are allowed and will all be used in the order shown:
.Pp
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/blacklist
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<setname>-blacklist
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<tree>-blacklist
.Dl /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/<jailname>-blacklist
