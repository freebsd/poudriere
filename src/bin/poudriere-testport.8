.Dt POUDRIERE-TESTPORT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm poudriere-testport
.Nd test a given port's build
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm poudriere
.Op Ar poudriere-options
.Cm testport
.Op Ar options
.Oo Fl o Oc Ar origin
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The specified port will be tested for build and packaging problems.
All missing dependencies will first be built in parallel.
.Ev TRYBROKEN=yes
is automatically defined in the environment to test ports marked as
.Ev BROKEN .
See
.Sx FLAVORS
in
.Xr poudriere 8
for supported FLAVORS syntax.
.Pp
One port origin must be specified.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffile"
.It Fl o Ar origin
Specifies an origin in the ports tree.
.It Fl B Ar name
Specify which buildname to use.
By default
.Ar YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS
will be used.
This can be used to resume a previous build and use the same log and URL paths.
Resuming a build will not retry built/failed/skipped/ignored packages.
.It Fl c
Run make config for the given port.
.It Fl i
Interactive mode.
Enter jail for interactive testing and automatically cleanup when done.
A local
.Xr pkg.conf 5
repository configuration will be installed to
.Pa LOCALBASE/etc/pkg/repos/local.conf
so that
.Xr pkg 8
can be used with any existing packages built for the jail.
The
.Fx
repository will be disabled by default.
.It Fl I
Advanced Interactive mode.
Leaves jail running with port installed after test.
When done with the jail you will need to manually shut it down:
.Dl "poudriere jail -k -j JAILNAME" .
As with
.Fl i
this will install a
.Xr pkg.conf 5
file for
.Xr pkg 8
usage.
.It Fl j Ar name
Runs only inside the jail named
.Ar name .
.It Fl J Ar number[:number]
This argument specifies how many
.Ar number
jobs will run in parallel for building the dependencies.
The optional second
.Ar number
is the number of jobs used for the steps before the build, they are more IO
bound than CPU bound, so you may want to use a different number.
The default pre-build value is 1.25 times the value of the build value.
.It Fl k
Do not consider failures as fatal.
Find all failures.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Show what would be done, but do not actually build or delete any
packages.
.It Fl N
Do not build package repository when build of dependencies is
completed.
.It Fl P
Use custom prefix.
.It Fl O Ar overlays
Specify extra ports trees to overlay.
.It Fl p Ar tree
Specifies which ports
.Ar tree
to use.
.It Fl S
Do not recursively rebuild packages affected by other packages requiring
incremental rebuild.
This may result in broken packages if the ones they depend on are updated,
are not ABI-compatible, and were not properly
.Sy PORTREVISION
bumped.
.It Fl v
This will show more information during the build.
Specify twice to enable debug output.
.It Fl w
Save WRKDIR on build failure.
The WRKDIR will be tarred up into
.Sy ${POUDRIERE_DATA}/wrkdirs .
.It Fl z Ar set
This specifies which SET to use for the build.
See
.Sx CUSTOMISATION
in
.Xr poudriere 8
for examples of how this is used.
