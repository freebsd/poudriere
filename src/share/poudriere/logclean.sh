poudriere logclean [options] <days | -a | -N count>

Parameters:
    -a          -- Remove all logfiles matching the filter
    days        -- How many days old of logfiles to keep matching the filter
    -N count    -- How many logfiles to keep matching the filter per
                   jail/tree/set combination.

Options:
    -B name     -- Build name glob to match on (defaults to *)
    -j jail     -- Which jail to use for log directories
    -p tree     -- Specify which ports tree to use for log directories
                   (Defaults to the 'default' tree)
    -n          -- Do not actually remove anything, just show what would be
                   removed
    -v          -- Be verbose; show more information. Use twice to enable
                   debug output
    -y          -- Assume yes when deleting and do not prompt for confirmation
    -z set      -- Specify which SET to match for logs. Use '0' to only
                   match on empty sets.
